# Recap Project 4: Weather & Activities App

This app fetches a weather object from an API and conditionally picks activities from a list to display as suggestions.
A feature has been implemented, that allows user to add more suggestions to the list of activities
and also allows to delete suggestions.

The way this app is going to handle data is a basic example of CRUD operations. CRUD stands for
Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are the main features every app needs.
